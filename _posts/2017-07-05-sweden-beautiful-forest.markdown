Over the years, i've learnt the significance of loving and respecting everyone around me. 
In life, all have a battle of their own. You are not the only one suffering. You are not alone.
The world is full of people who are scared, who need to be loved and cared of.
Come out of yourselves. Forget your sufferings and feel others pains. Understand them. Respect their struggles. Learn from their strengths. 
Because only when you realise others' hurts, would you recover from yours.

Make people happy. Appreciate them. Thank them for being so important in your life. Your gratitude might mean a lot to them. Your warm-hearted smile might make their day. It might make them do wonders.
Dont let negatives affect the way you shine. Let people find warmth in your brightness.

Always leave people happier and better than you found them.
Spread smiles. Spead happiness. Spread love.
Be kind. Be lovable. Be the reason someone smiles today. :)
