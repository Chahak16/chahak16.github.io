Lets just take out some time to understand the importance of self-love.

Your body, your mind, your soul... each and every inch of your skin is beautiful beyond measures! 
Those blemishes, those dark circled puffy eyes, the split ends of your hair, those stretch marks on your body,  those unkept eyebrows, the unwaxed skin, that extra fat on your stomach and thighs, define you.. make you unique and perfect in your own way.
Nobody should have the right to tell you that you are less attractive, that you have flaws, that you need to improve on your physical personality... because they dont know who you are! 
Nobody should tell you what you deserve, because only you know that you deserve the best of all, that you deserve yourself first; the best lover anyone can have. 
Ain't no one perfect in here..coz all are imperfectly perfect!
