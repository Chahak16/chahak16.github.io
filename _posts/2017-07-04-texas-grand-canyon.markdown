Dear society,
This is an open letter to all who are constantly.... telling me what to wear, where to go, how to sit, judging me for my boy-friends, judging me when i drink, when i return home late at night, criticising and hating me for my unconventional choices, not providing me a fair chance with my work, comparing my worthiness with my attractiveness and how much make up i've put on, degrading my essence while you still desire pleasing the Goddesses; 
Do you even know me? 
I am an independent thousandths, ruling my life my way. And i m happy to take charge of whatever i go through in my life. Good times or bad, i'll take it all with my unending spirits.My hardwork and perseverance will help me get through it all.
Your advices, your fake concern, your judgements, your criticism, your ridicule, Why?
All just to obstruct my path?  But hey, let me tell you, "I Wont Stop".
I have my family and my responsibilities, will you take care of them the way i do?
I have my aims and passions, would you satisfy them the way i'd do?
I am born with a purpose, would you fulfill it the way i'd do? 
I dont need your spines for achieving my goals. I dont care a whit of what you think of me.
I'm unstoppable. I'm me. 
Yours sincerely,
A strong woman irrepressible of your hinderance.
