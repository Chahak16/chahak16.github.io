In a world full of people..who have immense hatred, bitterness  jealousy and what not to offer to you..
There is so much to be joyous and elated about! 
Then why do we limit ourselves to certain things so bad..that it is difficult for us to be happy without them? 
Why do we keep our approach so timid..that we cant see the better and much merrier things in life? 
Why dont we understand the importance of those abundant  blessings that we have in our lives? 
Why do we always cry for small things and keep on ignoring the things that actually matter?  Why!
Ask this to yourselves, maybe you'd find true happiness someday! ðŸ’–ðŸŽ€
